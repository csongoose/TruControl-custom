Arduino error codes:
The oil pressure low light combined with others mean an error somewhere.
You can idntify an error code, because the arduino will no longer respond to your actions.
These are the following:
-Oil pressure + blinker left + blinker right : The arduino entered software emergency mode. Please check if pin number 2 isn't connected to GND.
