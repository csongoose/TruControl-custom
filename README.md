# TruControl-custom
A complete overhaul of the previous TruControl project, now with input handling!
-----
This project is made specifically for truck simulators, featuring realistic dashboard elements and custom inputs. With TruControl - custom, you are able to make the
already immersive driving experience even more immersive! This is something you can build at home if you want, and we encourage you to try stuff.

The inputs are not mandatory, you can use the software as you would have used the previous projects, although you might need to modify stuff in the Arduino sketch file.

-----
The project is way too complex to describe in a README. Please see the [documentation](https://github.com/csongoose/TruControl-custom/blob/master/Documentation/trucontrol_documentation.pdf) for detailed information!

Developers:
- Csongor 'csongoose' Csaszar - coding
- Baran Ismen - hardware
